        "description": "My name is Pau Mas Vilar and I am 22 years old. Since I was a child, I have been fascinated by the world of technology and creativity, a passion that today is reflected in my dedication to programming and web design.\n\nDuring my studies, I had the opportunity to develop my programming and design skills, focusing mainly on web technologies. I have had the opportunity to work with various technologies, mainly Java, HTML, CSS, MySQL, PHP, JavaScript, Laravel, Bootstrap and Tailwind, among others. In particular, my experience with PHP and Laravel has motivated me to program my own web pages and to continue expanding my knowledge in the field of web development.\n\nCurrently, I dedicate myself to developing my own web projects, which allow me to apply my knowledge in programming and design. At the same time, I am studying self-taught, expanding my knowledge and skills."
